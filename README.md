# Tic_Tac_Toe-With-AI

This is a mini-project i made in my journey of learning java .  A simple console TIC TAC TOE with 3 levels of difficutly ( easy , medium , hard ) :

## Easy Level


- Generates random moves using the Random Class 
## Medium Level


- Make moves using the following logic :  
  - If it already has two in a row and can win with one further move, it does so.
  - If its opponent can win with one move, it plays the move necessary to block this.
  - Otherwise, it makes a random move.
## Hard level 
- This stage was the most challenging one where i implemented the minimax algorithm .

In fine , it was a fun and intertaining project .
